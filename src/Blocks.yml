#This section allows you to define what blocks give exp, and how much.
#Make sure to put the block ID of the block, not the name, and then the
#amount of exp after it, like 56:
#                               exp: 20     Spacing is VERY important, so don't mess it up.  
Blocks:
  56:
    exp: 20
  1:
    exp: 2
